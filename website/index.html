      <h3>Shake, Shake, Shake, Shake your Booty SOCKS</h3>
      <img src="./IMG/SocksBluePurplesocks.jpeg" alt="">
      <p>Crank Crank Crank- crank your booty socks out fast with the Sock Peddler's help! This is a great introductory class for everyone but especially for kids because the project goes quickly and there is huge sense of accomplishment. The Sock Peddlers
        make one sock ahead of time. The second sock is “started” but gets finished by the class participant. So, this could be a quick party (around an hour) but why not plan for a couple of hours of fun with friends. We'll show you how to stitch your
        toesies closed so you can wear your socks home. Now, go pick a yarn from the SOCK YARN page and tell us what size to get shakin' and crankin'!</p>

      <h3>Sitting on The Dock of The Bay SOCKS</h3>
      <img src="./IMG/socks2.jpeg" alt="">
      <p>Of all the things that can be made on the circular sock machine, SOCKS are the prized project. But yes, you can really knit them too from beginning to end. The Sock Peddlers are going to be with you every stitch of the way and this is why no experience
        is necessary for these crew socks. You will feel absolutely accomplished every time you wear your socks. The length of this class is structured toward adults and teenagers. Will your socks be a treasured gift to someone or will you keep this first
        pair for yourself?</p>

      <p>Make arm, leg or wrist warmers. Which one would you like to do? Compared to the scarves class, this takes a little longer because "two" have to be made. This party would be perfect with a planned break in between the pair. Ask about mock ribbing!

      <p>Roger and Kathy Johansen celebrated five years of marriage in July 2016! They invite you to “crank” along as they now also will be doing business as THE SOCK PEDDLERS, LLC. It is their latest ride! They might have socks to sell; however, with them
        you will make-n-take your very own warm woolies using their circular sock machines!</p>
      <p>For the last few years, using traditional knitting needles, this side-by-side pair has been teaching children and adults of all ages to knit by hand. These activities led them to an antique circular sock machine (CSM). This knitting machine proved
        to be faster fun, allowing more pairs of socks to be knitted and IS the inspiration for their new Sock Adventure. Kathy and Roger’s passion for family, friends, fiber, knitting, history and community come together full cylinder circle with the
        cranking of their sock machines.</p>

      <p>During the school year, Kathy teaches 3rd grade and Roger is retired. When they are not working/volunteering/making socks, or at church, they enjoy walking (dogs too), riding bikes, entertaining, and volunteering at the Steilacoom Historical Museum.</p>

      <p>Together, Roger and Kathy have four adult children and eight grandchildren. Their two dogs complete their family! The Sock Peddlers are looking forward to helping you create the perfect pair of socks or other cylindrical surprises. Don’t ride tandem
        with this team. Instead, schedule early to catch them. They want to KNIT with you!</p>
